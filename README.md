AI-Powered Online Proctoring System
Designed an AI-driven proctoring system to monitor and prevent cheating in online exams. Utilizes real-time face recognition, person counting, and object detection to ensure exam integrity. Detects multiple faces, prevents spoofing, and flags prohibited items using OpenCV and YOLO. Provides secure, automated, and scalable proctoring solutions for online assessments. Developed using Python, Flask, OpenCV, dlib, and MySQL.
Key Features:
Face Detection & Recognition: Identifies registered students and prevents spoofing attacks using OpenCV and dlib.
Person Counting & Unauthorized Face Detection: Detects multiple faces and ensures only one test-taker is present.
Object Detection: Uses YOLO to detect prohibited items like mobile phones, books, and other cheating materials.
Technologies Used: Python, Flask, OpenCV, dlib, YOLO, MySQL.
